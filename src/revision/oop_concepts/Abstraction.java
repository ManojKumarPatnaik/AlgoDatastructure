         * Consider a classic “shape” example, perhaps used in a computer-aided design system or game simulation.
         * The base type is “shape” and each shape has a color, size and so on.
         * From this, specific types of shapes are derived(inherited)-circle, square, triangle and so on — each of which may
         * have additional characteristics and behaviors.
         * For example, certain shapes can be flipped. Some behaviors may be different, such as when you want to calculate the area of a shape.
         * The type hierarchy embodies both the similarities and differences between the shapes

         * Encapsulation vs Data Abstraction
         *
         * Encapsulation is data hiding(information hiding) while Abstraction is detail hiding(implementation hiding).
         * While encapsulation groups together data and methods that act upon the data, data abstraction deals with exposing the interface to the user and hiding the details of implementation.

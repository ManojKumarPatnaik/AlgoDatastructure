You may be thinking: there is a while loop inside of the for loop, isn't the time complexity O(n^2)O(n

 )? The reason it is still O(n)O(n) is that the while loop can only iterate nn times in total for the entire algorithm (left starts at 0, only increases, and never exceeds n). Even though the while loop can run n times on one iteration of the for loop, that would mean it wouldn't run at all for all the other iterations of the for loop. This is what we refer to as amortized analysis - even though the worst case for an iteration inside the for loop is O(n)O(n), it averages out to O(1)O(1) when you consider the entire runtime of the algorithm.

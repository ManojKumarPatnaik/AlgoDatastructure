Linked list -> stores a list of values but in a way that each value is connected or linked to the next value
Single linked list -> Each value is only connected to the next node. DATA|NEXT
Double linked list -> Each value is connected to the next node and previous node.
Circular linked list-> the last node is connected to the head. It has an address to the head

NB
Storing a list of values in a linked list can take up more memory than using a simple array because in addition to values
we have to store next and sometimes previous fields for each node. However adding a new value to a linked list is easy
Since you just extend the last node to add the new node also deleting is easy as you can just change the next
field of the previous node to point to the node after the node you wish to remove.

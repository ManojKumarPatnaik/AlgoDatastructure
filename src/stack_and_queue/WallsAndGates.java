     * Description
     * You are given a m x n 2D grid initialized with these three possible values.
     * <p>
     * -1 - A wall or an obstacle.
     * 0 - A gate.
     * INF - Infinity means an empty room. We use the value 2^31 - 1 = 2147483647 to represent INF as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than 2147483647.
     * Fill each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate. If it is impossible to reach a Gate, that room should remain filled with INF

     * Example
     * Example1
     * <p>
     * Input:
     * [[2147483647,-1,0,2147483647],[2147483647,2147483647,2147483647,-1],[2147483647,-1,2147483647,-1],[0,-1,2147483647,2147483647]]
     * Output:
     * [[3,-1,0,1],[2,2,1,-1],[1,-1,2,-1],[0,-1,3,4]]
     * <p>
     * Explanation:
     * the 2D grid is:
     * INF  -1  0  INF
     * INF INF INF  -1
     * INF  -1 INF  -1
     * 0  -1 INF INF
     * the answer is:
     * 3  -1   0   1
     * 2   2   1  -1
     * 1  -1   2  -1
     * 0  -1   3   4
     * Example2
     * <p>
     * Input:
     * [[0,-1],[2147483647,2147483647]]
     * Output:
     * [[0,-1],[1,2]]

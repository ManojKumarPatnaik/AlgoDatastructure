# Asymptotic Analysis

The asymptotic notation compares two functions,say, f(n) and g(n) for very large values of n

# Big O Notation

## General Tips
1. Every time a list or array gets iterated over c√ólength times, it is most likely in O(n)time.
2. When you see a problem where the number of elements in the problem space gets halved each time, it will most probably be in O(logn) runtime.
3. Whenever you have a single nested loop, the problem is most likely in quadratic time.

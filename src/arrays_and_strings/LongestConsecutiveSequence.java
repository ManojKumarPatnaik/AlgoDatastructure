         * Complexity Analysis

         * Time complexity : O(n)
         *
         * Although the time complexity appears to be quadratic due to the while loop nested within the for loop,
         * closer inspection reveals it to be linear.
         * Because the while loop is reached only when currentNum marks the beginning of a sequence
         * (i.e. currentNum-1 is not present in nums), the while loop can only run for nn iterations
         * throughout the entire runtime of the algorithm.
         * This means that despite looking like O(nâ‹…n) complexity, the nested loops actually run in O(n + n) = O(n) time.
         * All other computations occur in constant time, so the overall runtime is linear.
         *
         * Space complexity : O(n)
         *
         * In order to set up O(1) containment lookups,
         * we allocate linear space for a hash table to store the O(n) numbers in nums.
         * Other than that, the space complexity is identical to that of the brute force solution.

# Recursion
[Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv9NEXX1VHc)

 Recursion is an approach to solving problems using a function that calls itself as a subroutine.
 ```

- The trick is that each time a recursive function calls itself, it reduces the given problem into subproblems
  
A recursive function should have the following properties so that it does not result in an infinite loop:
1. A simple base case (or cases) â€” a terminating scenario that does not use recursion to produce an answer.
2. A set of rules, also known as recurrence relation that reduces all other cases towards the base case.

The space complexity of the recursion is O(n) as well.
* Each recursive call adds a new frame to the call stack, which requires space to store the local variables and parameters of that call.
* the space complexity is linear with respect to the length of the input string.

In most programming languages, including Java, the call stack used for recursion is managed by the runtime system and is not subject to garbage collection. The call stack is a specific region of memory that keeps track of function calls and their corresponding local variables and parameters.

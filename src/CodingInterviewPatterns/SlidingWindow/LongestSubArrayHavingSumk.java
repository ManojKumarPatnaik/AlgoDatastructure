         * The window starts empty, but we can grow it to [3, 1, 2]
         * while maintaining the constraint. However, after adding the 7, the window's sum becomes too large.
         * We need to tighten the window until the sum is below 8 again, which doesn't happen until our window looks like [7]. When we try to add the next element, our window again becomes too large, and we need to remove the 7 which means we have [4]. We can now grow the window until it looks like [4, 2, 1, 1], but adding the next element makes the sum too large. We remove elements from the left until it fits the constraint again, which happens at [1, 1, 5]. The longest subarray we found was [4, 2, 1, 1] which means the answer is 4.

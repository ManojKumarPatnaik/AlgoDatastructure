# String vs StringBuilder

- StringBuilder and String are both used for representing and manipulating text, but they have different characteristics and are used in different scenarios:

1. Immutability:

    - String: In Java, String objects are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once created. Any modification operation on a String results in creating a new String object.
    - StringBuilder: StringBuilder, on the other hand, is mutable. It allows you to modify its contents without creating a new object. This makes it more efficient when performing multiple concatenations or modifications to a string.
2. Performance:

    - String: Since String objects are immutable, concatenating or modifying strings using the "+" operator or String concatenation methods (e.g., concat) can result in the creation of many temporary String objects. This can be inefficient, especially when dealing with large strings or frequent modifications. 
    - StringBuilder: StringBuilder is designed for efficient string manipulation. It provides methods like append, insert, delete, etc., which modify the underlying character sequence of the StringBuilder object directly, without creating additional objects. This makes it more efficient for building or modifying strings.
3. Thread Safety:

    - String: String objects are inherently thread-safe because they are immutable. Multiple threads can safely read and share the same String object without any synchronization concerns. 
    - StringBuilder: StringBuilder is not thread-safe. If multiple threads modify the same StringBuilder object concurrently, it can lead to inconsistent or unexpected results. If thread safety is required, you can use the thread-safe alternative, StringBuffer.
4. Usage:

    - String: Strings are typically used when the value does not change frequently and immutability is desired, such as representing constant values, method parameters, or return values. 
    - StringBuilder: StringBuilder is used when you need to concatenate or modify strings frequently, especially in loops or situations where performance is a concern, such as building dynamic or large strings.

- In summary, if you need to perform frequent modifications to a string, concatenations, or building dynamic strings, StringBuilder is generally a better choice due to its mutability and better performance. However, if you have a fixed string value that won't change, or thread safety is a concern, using String is more appropriate

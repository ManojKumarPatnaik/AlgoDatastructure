# subarray vs subset vs subsequence



"Subarray," "subset," and "subsequence" are terms used in the context of arrays, sets, or sequences in mathematics and computer science. They refer to different concepts, each with its own characteristics:

Subarray:

A subarray is a contiguous (consecutive) portion of an array.
All the elements in a subarray are adjacent to each other in the original array.
Subarrays are often used when dealing with arrays or lists in programming to perform operations on a specific part of the data.
Example: In the array [1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 3] is a subarray because its elements are adjacent in the original array.

Subset:

A subset is a collection of elements from a set or an array where these elements can appear in any order, and they may not be adjacent.
A subset can be smaller or equal in size to the original set or array.
The order of elements in a subset doesn't matter.
Example: In the set {1, 2, 3}, {1, 2} is a subset because it contains elements from the original set, and the order doesn't matter.

Subsequence:

A subsequence is a sequence of elements from a larger sequence (e.g., string, array) where these elements appear in the same relative order as in the original sequence.
Elements in a subsequence may not be adjacent, and some elements may be skipped.
Subsequences can be smaller or equal in size to the original sequence.
Example: In the sequence "abcde," "ace" is a subsequence because it contains elements from the original sequence, and the order is preserved.

To summarize, subarrays are contiguous parts of arrays, subsets are collections of elements where order doesn't matter, and subsequences are sequences of elements that maintain their relative order within a larger sequence. These concepts are important in various algorithms, data manipulation, and programming tasks.

Combinations and subsets lies in their purpose and the mathematical treatment of the order of selection. Combinations focus on selecting a specific number of elements from a set without regard to order, while subsets encompass all possible collections of elements from a set, regardless of order or size.
